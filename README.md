# news_mining

This project reads data from the tagesschau API and parses them into Entry objects. It frequently loads the data from the API, parses it and writes it into a database.

This is to obtain an overview about the news published by the tagesschau over a certain period of time. After collecting the data, we will make some further analysis on it.
